I do believe\n","Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that\n","Apollo would, this being indeed the issue\n","Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\n","Either for life or death, upon the earth\n","Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!\n","There lie, and there thy character: there these;\n","Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\n","And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,\n","That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed\n","To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\n","But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I\n","To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!\n","The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have\n","A lullaby too rough: I never saw\n","The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\n","Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:\n","I am gone for ever.\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","I would there were no age between sixteen and\n","three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the\n","rest; for there is nothing in the between but\n","getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,\n","stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but\n","these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty\n","hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\n","best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find\n","than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by\n","the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy\n","will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very\n","pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A\n","pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:\n","though I am not bookish, yet I can read\n","waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been\n","some stair-work, some trunk-work, some\n","behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this\n","than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for\n","pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed\n","but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!\n","\n","Clown:\n","Hilloa, loa!\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk\n","on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What\n","ailest thou, man?\n","\n","Clown:\n","I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!\n","but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the\n","sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust\n","a bodkin's point.\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","Why, boy, how is it?\n","\n","Clown:\n","I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,\n","how it takes up the shore! but that's not the\n","point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!\n","sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the\n","ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon\n","swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a\n","cork into a hogshead. And then for the\n","land-service, to see how the bear tore out his\n","shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said\n","his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an\n","end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned\n","it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the\n","sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared\n","and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than\n","the sea or weather.\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","Name of mercy, when was this, boy?\n","\n","Clown:\n","Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these\n","sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor\n","the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it\n","now.\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!\n","\n","Clown:\n","I would you had been by the ship side, to have\n","helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,\n","boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things\n","dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for\n","thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's\n","child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;\n","open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be\n","rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:\n","open't. What's within, boy?\n","\n","Clown:\n","You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth\n","are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up\n","with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.\n","We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires\n","nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good\n","boy, the next way home.\n","\n","Clown:\n","Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see\n","if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much\n","he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they\n","are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury\n","it.\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that\n","which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the\n","sight of him.\n","\n","Clown:\n","Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.\n","\n","Shepherd:\n","'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.\n","\n","Time:\n","I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror\n","Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\n","Now take upon me, in the name of Time,\n","To use my wings.

Let me pass\n","The same I am, ere ancient'st order was\n","Or what is now received: I witness to\n","The times that brought them in; so shall I do\n","To the freshest things now reigning and make stale\n","The glistering of this present, as my tale\n","Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\n","I turn my glass and give my scene such growing\n","As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,\n","The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving\n","That he shuts up himself, imagine me,\n","Gentle spectators, that I now may be\n","In fair Bohemia, and remember well,\n","I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel\n","I now name to you; and with speed so pace\n","To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\n","Equal with wondering: what of her ensues\n","I list not prophecy; but let Time's news\n","Be known when 'tis brought forth.\n","A shepherd's daughter,\n","And what to her adheres, which follows after,\n","Is the argument of Time.

How goes it now, sir? this news\n","which is called true is so like an old tale, that\n","the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king\n","found his heir?\n","\n","Third Gentleman:\n","Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by\n","circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you\n","see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle\n","of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,\n","the letters of Antigonus found with it which they\n","know to be his character, the majesty of the\n","creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection\n","of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,\n","and many other evidences proclaim her with all\n","certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see\n","the meeting of the two kings?\n","\n","Second Gentleman:\n","No.\n","\n","Third Gentleman:\n","Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,\n","cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one\n","joy crown another, so and in such manner that it\n","seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their\n","joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,\n","holding up of hands, with countenances of such\n","distraction that they were to be known by garment,\n","not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of\n","himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that\n","joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,\n","thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then\n","embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\n","daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\n","shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\n","conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such\n","another encounter, which lames report to follow it\n","and undoes description to do it.\n","\n","Second Gentleman:\n","What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried\n","hence the child?\n","\n","Third Gentleman:\n","Like an old tale still, which will have matter to\n","rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\n","open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this\n","avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his\n","innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a\n","handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\n","\n","First Gentleman:\n","What became of his bark and his followers?\n","\n","Third Gentleman:\n","Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and\n","in the view of the shepherd: so that all the\n","instruments which aided to expose the child were\n","even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble\n","combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in\n","Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of\n","her husband, another elevated that the oracle was\n","fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,\n","and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin\n","her to her heart that she might no more be in danger\n","of losing.\n","\n","First Gentleman:\n","The dignity of this act was worth the audience of\n","kings and princes; for by such was it acted.\n","\n","Third Gentleman:\n","One of the prettiest touches of all and that which\n","angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not\n","the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's\n","death, with the manner how she came to't bravely\n","confessed and lamented by the king, how\n","attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one\n","sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'\n","I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my\n","heart wept blood.

es una biblioteca de Python de código abierto utilizada para el modelado de temas, indexación de documentos y recuperación de similitud. Permite analizar grandes colecciones de texto y descubrir patrones semánticos ocultos dentro de los documentos. Gensim es popular en el campo del procesamiento del lenguaje natural (PLN) y el aprendizaje automático, ya que ofrece herramientas eficientes para tareas como la creación de modelos de tópicos (por ejemplo, LDA) y la generación de incrustaciones de palabras (word embeddings), como Word2Vec."],"metadata":{"id":"G94vn4yYgJDy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.1 Word2Vec en Gensim\n","\n","La implementación de Word2Vec en Gensim se distingue por su enfoque práctico y eficiente, especialmente en el manejo de grandes volúmenes de texto. Un factor crucial en esta eficiencia es el uso de \"negative sampling\". Esta técnica aborda el alto costo computacional de entrenar modelos Word2Vec al no intentar actualizar todos los pesos del modelo en cada iteración. En su lugar, para cada palabra objetivo y su contexto, selecciona aleatoriamente un pequeño número de \"palabras negativas\" (palabras que no aparecen en el contexto) y solo actualiza los pesos asociados con estas palabras y las palabras de contexto reales. Esto reduce drásticamente el número de cálculos necesarios, permitiendo que Gensim entrene modelos Word2Vec de alta calidad en conjuntos de datos extensos de manera mucho más rápida y con menor consumo de recursos. Además, la interfaz intuitiva de Gensim facilita la experimentación y el ajuste de parámetros, permitiendo a los usuarios adaptar el modelo a sus necesidades específicas con relativa facilidad.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"87bdhItUgZ7j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["En primer lugar, obtengamos nuestro vocabulario."],"metadata":{"id":"oGX2vJ5NBex6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["vocabulary = list(set([token for sent in oraciones_preprocesadas for token in sent]))\n","print(f'Tamaño del vocabulario: {len(vocabulary)} tokens')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DaG5qJtH8GvV","outputId":"fa276549-4cee-4943-e5f1-c705a093dc57","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743866097973,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":31,"user":{"displayName":"Carlos Andres Gomez Vasco","userId":"02293680002023987679"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Tamaño del vocabulario: 5606 tokens\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["La función models.Word2Vec de Gensim ofrece una amplia gama de parámetros que permiten personalizar el entrenamiento del modelo Word2Vec según las necesidades específicas de tu conjunto de datos y tarea. veamolos:\n","\n","**Parámetros principales:**\n","\n","* **sentences:**\n","    * Este parámetro es el corpus de entrenamiento.

Valores típicos oscilan entre 100 y 300. Un mayor número de dimensiones puede capturar relaciones más complejas, pero requiere más datos y tiempo de entrenamiento.\n","* **window:**\n","    * Especifica el tamaño de la ventana de contexto. Determina cuántas palabras antes y después de la palabra objetivo se consideran para el entrenamiento.\n","* **min\\_count:**\n","    * Ignora todas las palabras con una frecuencia total inferior a este valor. Esto ayuda a reducir el ruido y el tamaño del vocabulario.\n","* **workers:**\n","    * Controla el número de hilos de trabajo para entrenar el modelo. Un mayor número de trabajadores puede acelerar el entrenamiento en sistemas con múltiples núcleos.\n","* **sg:**\n","    * Define el algoritmo de entrenamiento. 0 para CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) y 1 para Skip-gram. Skip-gram tiende a funcionar mejor con conjuntos de datos pequeños y palabras poco frecuentes.\n","* **hs:**\n","    * Si es 1, se utiliza softmax jerárquico para el entrenamiento.
